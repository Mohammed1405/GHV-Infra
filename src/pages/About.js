            <p>
              <strong>Founded in 1980</strong>, GHV Infra began as a small construction company with a focus on local projects.
              Over the past four decades, we have expanded our operations, expertise, and portfolio to become a leader in the
              infrastructure industry. Our growth has been fueled by our commitment to quality, innovation, and client satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the <strong>1990s</strong>, we had completed numerous projects, gaining recognition for our work in roads, highways,
              and bridges. Our dedication to excellence earned us partnerships with government bodies and private organizations,
              paving the way for larger, more ambitious projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new millennium brought us into the global stage. In the early <strong>2000s</strong>, GHV Infra began handling
              multi-million dollar projects, spanning various sectors including urban development, transportation, and industrial
              infrastructure. We embraced cutting-edge technologies and sustainable practices, making us a trusted name in the
              infrastructure world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we are proud to be a part of India's infrastructure revolution, having delivered over <strong>200+ major projects</strong>
              that include highways, bridges, airports, and urban infrastructures. Our story continues as we push the boundaries of
